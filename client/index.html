            content="Thryve is a web application that connects skilled individuals like, freelancers, artisans, plumbers, with clients who need their services. It has AI-enhanced discovery, smart recommendations, and project-based showcases, Thryve becomes more than a portfolio or job board – it’s a dynamic ecosystem. It bridges the gap between skilled artisans and potential employer and investores where talented individuals struggle to showcase their work in meaningful ways, and investors/employers face difficulty in identifying, validating, and collaborating with emerging talents.
